# AI MATH EDUCTION

## requirements

1. individual model for each of the subject from nepali curriculum class 4 to class 12 {maths(questions and step by step solutions and conceptual understanding concepts,geometry and sets chapter is it feasible?, should include optional maths concepts and questions), nepali (question answer set and grammar rules with samples),english(questions answers and grammar rules, and english  writing samples), social (question answers samples from every chapter), science (question answers any science related concepts available within the weight of the base model.),}

2. training resources within PC resource plus google colab with compute resources (company won't be funding at all.)

3. framework PyTorch, HuggingfaceTransformer.

4. finetuning libraries (xtuner, unsloth, transformers)

5. inference backend (llama.cpp,vllm, triton server)


## Key considerations.

**garbage in garbage out**

dataset preparation should take maximum time but fixed and very actionable planing, one dataset, one model one evaluation at a time. don't start with math, start with nepali,social, english (a language subject first).

base models should  be reasoning or not, i think reasoning is required but it also increases  the  resource requirement along the the throughput rate and latency. 

every subjects requires reasoning model.

question answering is primary feature for this project but integration of pedagogy enhanced with AI is another feature. Such pedagogical philosophy for reflective and effective digital learning  is the main focus of mysecondteacher platform. This philosophy can be hugely impacted with the integration of efficient large language models along with AI assisted reflective and effective learning can be sun ma suganda. 

can we integrate the llms with the content of mysecondteacher videos lessons? students learns from video sessions and communicate with llms at the same time? this can be absolutely groundbreaking.
